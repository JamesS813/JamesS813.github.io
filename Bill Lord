    <h2>About Him</h2>
    <p>Bill Lord was a man of wisdom, humor, and resilience. He taught several people the value of kindness. He was the most religious man most had ever known, so loving and full of respect for everyone around him. Throughout his lifetime, he made countless friends. People felt blessed to be his friends, his family, or even to share a conversation with him.</p>
    <p>On the side of one of his cabinets, Bill had a sign that reads: "If you sleep in it... Make it up; If you wear it... Hang it up; If you drop it... Pick it up;If you eat out of it... Wash it out; If you spill it... Wipe it up; If you turn it on... Turn it off; If you open it... Close it; If you move it... Put it back; If you break it... Repair it; If you empty it... Fill it up; If it rings... Answer it; If it howls... Feed it; If it cries... LOVE IT." This sign matters because it reflects the way he lived. He never left anything unfinished, undone, or uncared for. Anyone who was around him felt comforted during difficult times. He was truly one in a million someone who cared for everyone and anybody.</p>
